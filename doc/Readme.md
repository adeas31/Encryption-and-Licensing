## Important notice about the Documentation in this folder

Please note that the official draft specification for SEMLA now lives in the Modelica CChange Proposal MCP 0039 at https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaSpecification/pull/2931.
But this may still be the best place if you want a quick understanding about how SEMLA works, so for the time being it is left here in place. 

But: **THIS IS NOT THE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE FOR THE SEMLA SPECIFICATION ANY LONGER!** If you are looking for that, please see the link to the PR above.
